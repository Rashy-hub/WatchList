# Watchlist

My first .NET MVC Watchlist application created following the openclassroom ASP.NET course. It's a simple system for listing and rating movies you've seen or owned. 
The application will use a relational database to store the information you enter, including the rating (from 1 to 5 stars) you assign to each film.
You'll then be able to search, view and sort your movie list using a variety of criteria.
