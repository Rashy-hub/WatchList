# Watchlist

This is my first ASP.NET MVC Watchlist application, initially created by following the **OpenClassrooms ASP.NET course**. However, as always, I went a few steps further by adding **additional features and extra content**, such as a UML design.

In summary, itâ€™s a simple system for listing and rating movies you've seen or own. The application uses a relational database to store the information you enter, including the rating (from 1 to 5 stars) you assign to each film.

You can search, view, and sort your movie list using a variety of criteria.

## Class Diagram (WIP) first iteration :)
